# RUSH-Scouting-2017
The 2017 Scouting app.
This is the 2017 scouting app in it's fullest.

  The scouting app's purpose is to be used during a tournament, and record data of the robots during the match
  
  The scouting app creates a CSV file saved within the documents folder of the app when the "Submit" button is pressed
  
  In order to fully use the scouting app the Python Scrpit must be used to compile the CSV files from the Ipads,
    and then you must also use Tableau to view the .xsl file in a much more graphic format than a spreadsheet
